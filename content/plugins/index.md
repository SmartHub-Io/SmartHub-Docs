Docc is a starter theme for [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) which is a static site generator powered by Vue. It allows you to quickly start writing your technical documentation for any kind of project.

## Fast by default

This is the catchphrase of Gridsome and true in any sense of the word. Static site generators output plain html files and have other great features like image processing and lazy-loading. After Serving the initial html, Gridsome site turn into a snappy single page application.

If I may quote Gridsome themselves:

> Gridsome builds ultra performance into every page automatically. You get code splitting, asset optimization, progressive images, and link prefetching out of the box. With Gridsome you get almost perfect page speed scores by default.
