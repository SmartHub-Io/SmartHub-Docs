    - Go to "SmartHub.Ui/"
        - Type into terminal `npm install`
    - Go to "SmartHub.Api/"
        - Type into terminal `dotnet ef database update`

### Run

1. Run `docker-compose up` from the folder
    - Run `dotnet ef database update`. Only run this on DB changes or during the first time
2. Run `dotnet run Use_Staticfiles_DEV=false Pgsql_User=<your name> Pgsql_pwd=<your pwd>` from "SmartHub.Api" folder
    - Or in your IDE run the "SmartHub.Api--Args" project Task from "launchSetting.json".
3. Run `npm run serve` from the "SmartHub.Ui/" folder

__Pgsql_User__ => the user you gave to your docker postgres container \
__Pgsql_pwd__ => the pwd you gave to your docker postgres container
__Use_Staticfiles_DEV__ => indicates wheter the pogramm uses a proxy to the seperated started Ui or servers the Ui as static files (default is "false")
> Running the programm without these args will cause errors at the moment !!!

### Database Ui
For a nice postgresql-ui a pgadmin container is also started, go to [Link](http://localhost:5050) and type in the credentials from the compose file.
If you don't like that you can of course still connect any other tool with the database.
