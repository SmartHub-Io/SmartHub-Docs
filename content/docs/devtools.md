# Devtools

Anything an interested developer who wants to help or use this project for himself can find needed tools and
information here. ðŸš€

## Docker
`docker ps` => to show all running container  
`docker images` => to show all downloaded images  
`docker pull postgres:alpine` => get latest stable version (12 atm)  
`docker run --name postgres-smartHub -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=1234 -d -p 5432:5432 postgres:alpine` => to run the postgres image under given name and pass in the   wanted password. If no user is specified with "POSTGRES_USER=<...>" than the default user will be __postgres__\
To run the container not from `docker-compose`

### Docker Compose
Got to the root/solution folder and type in the terminal
`docker-compose up`
or if you want to only start postgres you can call the mentioned __run__ command from earlier.

To stop all contaienr from that compose file press ctrl+c or if you used `docker-compose up -d` type `docker-compose down` or press if you.

## Dotnet user secrets cli
`dotnet user-secrets` => to show all secrets  
`dotnet user-secrets init` => initialize  
`dotnet user-secrets set "Movies:ServiceApiKey" "12345" --project C:\apps\WebApp1\src\WebApp1" ` => set key(Movies:ServiceApiKey) and value(12345) pair for project (C:\apps\WebApp1\src\WebApp1).
Not to the solution.  
`dotnet user-secrets` => shows help in terminal (one way to show the help page in terminal)

For more information got to the official [microsoft page](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=windows).
